## Research Initiatives

### Project Prometheus

A $500 million initiative to develop:

- Self-replicating medical nanobots
- Biological computing systems
- Synthetic organisms for terraforming
- Age-reversal therapies

### Project Atlas

Partnering with NASA to create:

- Biological life support systems for Mars missions
- Food production systems for long-duration space flight
- Radiation-resistant organisms

### Project Quantum Bridge

A joint research initiative with Chronos Energy Labs (est. 2025):

- Biological synthesis of chronium-7 crystalline lattices for quantum energy storage
- Enzymatic pathways for producing ultra-pure quantum materials at room temperature
- Reducing production costs of quantum flux capacitor components by 60%
- Bio-engineered organisms capable of maintaining quantum coherence in living systems

Early results show promise in using modified extremophile bacteria to naturally form the precise crystalline structures required for quantum entanglement storage, potentially revolutionizing both industries.
